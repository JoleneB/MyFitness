#Vision  Statement

MyFitness is a fitness application that targets beginners and veterans alike. Within this application the user can easily browse through workouts and create a workout that suits their own needs. For example, if a customer wished to complete a workout on their arms, theyâ€™d choose arms from the targeted area and a list of suitable arm workouts would appear. The customer continues and choses their prefered arm workout from the list available. The customer can choose the amount of reps and sets to suit their own needs. Once the workout is created, the  user is allowed to view, amend or delete the created workout. This application will benefit anyone interested in increasing their fitness as it is an easy and quick way of keeping track and creating workouts.
